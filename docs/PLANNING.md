### 3. Alarm States & Modes

#### Alarm States
- **Disarmed**: All sensors inactive
- **Home/Stay**: Perimeter protection (doors/windows), interior motion disabled
- **Away**: Full protection, all sensors active
- **Night**: Similar to home but with some interior sensors
- **Vacation**: Away mode with additional automation (lights, etc.)

#### Entry/Exit Delays
- Configurable delay timers
- Different delays per entry point
- Countdown display/beeping
- Quick arm/disarm during delay

#### State Management
- State change logging
- Required authentication per state
- Scheduled state changes (e.g., auto-arm at bedtime)
- Geofencing integration for auto disarm when approaching

### 4. System Settings & Configuration

Inspired by Home Assistant's manual alarm integration, the system provides extensive configuration options for timing, behavior, and code requirements.

#### Global Timing Settings

**Delay Time** (Default: 60 seconds)
- Entry delay before alarm triggers
- Countdown period after entering while armed
- Allows time to disarm before triggering
- Configurable per-state override

**Arming Time** (Default: 60 seconds)
- Exit delay when arming the system
- Time to leave before alarm activates
- Countdown display during arming
- Configurable per-state override

**Trigger Time** (Default: 120 seconds)
- Duration alarm remains in triggered state
- How long sirens/alerts stay active
- After trigger time, system behavior depends on disarm_after_trigger setting
- Configurable per-state override

#### Behavioral Settings

**Disarm After Trigger** (Default: false)
- If true: System auto-disarms after trigger time expires
- If false: System returns to previously armed state after trigger time
- Security consideration: Auto-disarm may not be suitable for all installations

**Code Arm Required** (Default: true)
- Whether code is required to arm the system
- If false: Allows one-touch arming without authentication
- Disarm always requires code for security

**Available Arming States** (Optional restriction)
- Limit which arm modes are available to users
- Options: armed_away, armed_home, armed_night, armed_vacation, armed_custom_bypass
- If not specified, all states are available
- Useful for simplifying UI or restricting certain modes

#### Per-State Timing Overrides

Each alarm state can have custom timing that overrides global defaults:

**Disarmed State**
- Not typically used for timing overrides
- Can have custom entry behavior

**Armed Away**
- Example: Longer entry delay (90s) for fumbling with keys
- Example: Standard trigger time (120s)
- Full perimeter and interior protection

**Armed Home/Stay**
- Example: Shorter entry delay (30s) since you're home
- Example: Shorter trigger time (90s) for faster response
- Only perimeter protection active

**Armed Night**
- Example: Minimal entry delay (15s) - unexpected at night
- Example: Immediate or very short arming time (10s)
- Enhanced security during sleep hours

**Armed Vacation**
- Example: No entry delay (0s) - no one should be entering
- Example: Extended trigger time (300s) for monitoring service response
- Maximum security, no legitimate entry expected

**Armed Custom Bypass**
- User-defined timing based on specific scenario
- Example: Maintenance mode with extended delays

**Triggered State**
- Trigger time override
- Can have different siren patterns/durations

#### Code Configuration

**Code Requirement Matrix**
- Arm from disarmed: Optional (based on code_arm_required)
- Disarm from any armed state: Required (always)
- Change between armed states: Configurable
- Trigger manual panic: May bypass for emergency

**Code Templates**
- Dynamic code validation based on state transitions
- Different codes can be required for different state changes
- Variables available: from_state, to_state, user, time
- Example: Require master code to disarm from triggered state

#### Quick Actions

**Quick Arm**
- One-touch arming to specific state
- No code required (if code_arm_required is false)
- Common for "leaving home" scenario
- Example: Single button to arm_away

**Delayed Disarm**
- Enter code during entry delay
- Countdown visible to user
- Beep pattern indicates remaining time
- Cancel alarm before trigger

#### Audio/Visual Feedback Settings

**Beep Patterns**
- Entry delay: Slow beeps increasing to fast
- Exit delay: Steady beeps
- Armed: Single confirmation beep
- Disarmed: Two-tone confirmation
- Triggered: Continuous alarm tone

**Countdown Display**
- Show remaining seconds during delays
- Visual progress bar
- Color coding (green → yellow → red)
- Can be disabled for stealth mode

#### Sensor Behavior Settings

**Open Door/Window Warning**
- Warn if trying to arm with sensors open
- Option to bypass automatically
- List which sensors are preventing arming
- Force arm option (admin only)

**Sensor Delay Groups**
- Different entry delays for different entry points
- Example: Front door 60s, back door 30s, garage 45s
- Based on expected usage patterns

#### State Machine with Timing

The alarm system uses a state machine that incorporates timing for smooth transitions:

**Arming Flow:**
```
Disarmed → [Code entered to arm] → Arming (exit delay) → Armed
         └─ During arming period: countdown displayed
         └─ Can cancel during exit delay
         └─ After arming_time expires: transition to Armed state
```

**Entry Flow (Normal disarm):**
```
Armed → [Sensor triggered] → Pending (entry delay) → [Code entered] → Disarmed
      └─ During pending: countdown displayed
      └─ Beeps indicate urgency
      └─ Must enter code before delay_time expires
```

**Entry Flow (Failed disarm):**
```
Armed → [Sensor triggered] → Pending (entry delay) → [No code or wrong code] → Triggered
      └─ After delay_time expires without valid code
      └─ Triggers sirens/alerts
      └─ Remains triggered for trigger_time duration
```

**Triggered Flow (with disarm_after_trigger = false):**
```
Triggered → [trigger_time expires] → Returns to previous armed state
          └─ Or [Code entered during trigger] → Disarmed
```

**Triggered Flow (with disarm_after_trigger = true):**
```
Triggered → [trigger_time expires] → Disarmed
          └─ Or [Code entered during trigger] → Disarmed
```

**State Transitions Summary:**
- `disarmed` → `arming` (on arm command)
- `arming` → `armed_*` (after arming_time)
- `arming` → `disarmed` (on cancel/disarm during exit delay)
- `armed_*` → `pending` (on sensor trigger)
- `pending` → `disarmed` (on valid code)
- `pending` → `triggered` (after delay_time without code)
- `triggered` → `disarmed` (on valid code OR after trigger_time if disarm_after_trigger=true)
- `triggered` → `armed_*` (after trigger_time if disarm_after_trigger=false)

- Do Not Disturb schedules
- Notification grouping/throttling

#### Home Assistant Notification Integration

**Notification Service Integration:**
- Leverage HA's `notify` service for multi-platform delivery
- Support all HA-configured notify platforms:
  - Mobile apps (iOS, Android)
  - Telegram
  - Discord
  - Pushover
  - Pushbullet
  - Slack
  - HTML5 push
  - And 50+ other integrations

**Actionable Notifications:**
- Code used: "View details" or "Dismiss"
- Alarm triggered: "Disarm", "View cameras", "Call police"
- Motion detected: "View camera snapshot", "Arm system"
- Door left open: "Close notification", "Bypass sensor"

**TTS Announcements:**
- Announce alarm state changes through smart speakers
- Entry/exit delay countdowns
- "Front door opened while armed away"
- "Guest code used by John's dog walker"
- Configurable voice and volume per event type

**Persistent Notifications:**
- Critical events stay in HA UI until acknowledged
- Alarm triggered events
- Failed arm attempts (sensor open)
- System errors or connection issues

**Mobile App Features:**
- Rich notifications with images (camera snapshots)
- Critical alerts (bypass Do Not Disturb)
- Location-aware notifications
- Notification history synced across devices

**Actionable Notification Callbacks:**
- Register webhook with Home Assistant for action callbacks
- Handle action responses asynchronously
- Support for:
  - Disarm system (requires code verification)
  - View cameras (return video stream URL)
  - Bypass sensor
  - Acknowledge alert
  - Execute custom automation
- Security: Validate webhook signature/token
- Log all actions taken via notifications

**Configurable State-Change Push Notifications (Phase 1–2)**
- Add a settings-driven option to push notifications to Home Assistant on selected alarm state changes.
- Supported “events” (initial):
  - Armed (per mode): `armed_home`, `armed_away`, `armed_night`, `armed_vacation`
  - `disarmed`
  - `pending` (entry delay started)
  - `triggered`
  - (Optional) `arming` (exit delay started) and `triggered_cleared` (disarm from triggered)
- Configuration knobs:
  - Enable/disable per state (or per transition: `from_state` → `to_state`).
  - Select HA notify target:
    - `notify.notify` (default) OR an explicit `notify.*` service (e.g. `notify.mobile_app_*`).
  - Message templates (simple): title/body per event; include variables like `to_state`, `from_state`, `timestamp`, `user_display_name`.
  - Throttling/cooldown per event type (avoid spam during flapping).
  - Optional “critical” flag for `triggered` (platform-dependent behavior).
- Delivery path:
  - On every state transition, emit an `AlarmEvent` (already a core requirement).
  - A background job (Celery) consumes state-change events and calls HA `notify` via the `HomeAssistantGateway`.
  - Failures should be non-blocking for the state transition (log + surface in system health).

- **Entity Sync** (every 60s): Sync entity states from HA to cache
- **Code Cleanup** (daily): Expire and remove old temporary codes
- **Event Archival** (daily): Archive old events per retention policy
- **Notification Retry** (every 5m): Retry failed notifications
- **Automation Scheduler** (every 1m): Check time-based automation triggers
- **Hardware Heartbeat** (every 30s): Check hardware device health
- **Audit Log Integrity** (hourly): Verify audit log signatures

### On-Demand Tasks
- `send_notification`: Send notification via specified channel
- `execute_automation`: Run automation actions
- `sync_ha_entities`: Full entity discovery and sync
- `capture_camera_snapshot`: Get snapshot from Frigate/camera
- `trigger_siren`: Activate siren with timeout
- `send_ha_command`: Execute HA service call
- `process_mqtt_message`: Handle incoming MQTT messages
- `run_drill`: Execute alarm drill sequence
- `export_audit_log`: Generate audit log export
- `import_config`: Validate and apply config import

### Task Configuration
```python
CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE = {
    'health-check': {'task': 'alarm.tasks.health_check', 'schedule': 30.0},
    'entity-sync': {'task': 'alarm.tasks.sync_entities', 'schedule': 60.0},
    'code-cleanup': {'task': 'alarm.tasks.cleanup_codes', 'schedule': crontab(hour=3)},
    'event-archival': {'task': 'alarm.tasks.archive_events', 'schedule': crontab(hour=4)},
}
```

### Task Retry Strategy
- Notifications: 3 retries with exponential backoff (1m, 5m, 15m)
- HA commands: 5 retries with 10s intervals
- Critical tasks (siren, alarm): No retry limit, immediate retry

---

## Error Handling & Resilience

### HA Connection Failure
1. Mark HA status as degraded
2. Switch to cached entity states
3. Queue outgoing commands for retry
4. Continue basic arm/disarm with local state
5. Trigger local siren relay if alarm triggers
6. Notify admins of connection loss
7. Auto-reconnect with backoff (1s, 2s, 4s... max 60s)

### MQTT Connection Failure
1. Mark MQTT status as degraded
2. Buffer outgoing messages (limited queue)
3. Continue without MQTT-based devices
4. Reconnect with backoff
5. Replay buffered messages on reconnect

### Notification Failure
1. Log failure with error details
2. Queue for retry (max 3 attempts)
3. Try fallback channels (email → SMS → HA push)
4. Mark as failed after all retries exhausted
5. Critical alerts: Continue trying indefinitely

### Database Failure
1. Return cached responses where possible
2. Queue writes for retry
3. Alarm operations continue with in-memory state
4. Alert admins immediately
5. Graceful degradation of non-critical features

### Automation Failure
1. Log error with full context
2. Mark automation as errored
3. Continue with other automations
4. Notify admin if critical automation fails
5. Circuit breaker: Disable after repeated failures

### State Recovery
- On startup: Load last known state from database
- Verify state with HA entities
- Reconcile any discrepancies
- Log state recovery actions
- Resume pending automations/timers

5. Configure Home Assistant connection
6. Configure alarm settings (timing, behavior, etc.)
7. Discover and map entities
8. Configure zones
9. Set up automations
10. Configure notifications

### Default Alarm Settings Profile

The system will create a default settings profile on first run with these values:

```json
{
  "name": "Default",
  "is_active": true,
  "delay_time": 60,
  "arming_time": 60,
  "trigger_time": 120,
  "disarm_after_trigger": false,
  "code_arm_required": true,
  "available_arming_states": [
    "armed_away",
    "armed_home",
    "armed_night",
    "armed_vacation"
  ],
  "state_overrides": {},
  "audio_visual_settings": {
    "beep_enabled": true,
    "countdown_display_enabled": true,
    "color_coding_enabled": true
  },
  "sensor_behavior": {
    "warn_on_open_sensors": true,
    "auto_bypass_enabled": false,
    "force_arm_enabled": true
  }
}
```

### Example Settings Profiles

**Quick Response Profile** (For occupied homes with pets)
```json
{
  "name": "Quick Response",
  "delay_time": 30,

    },
    "armed_night": {
      "delay_time": 10,
      "arming_time": 15
    }
  }
}
```

## Risks & Open Questions

### Technical Risks

1. **HA WebSocket Stability**
   - HA WebSocket can disconnect; need robust reconnection
   - Consider polling fallback for critical state sync
   - Test under various network conditions

2. **Real-time Latency**
   - Alarm state changes must be near-instantaneous
   - Entry delay countdown needs sub-second accuracy
   - Consider using Redis pub/sub for internal events

3. **Database Performance**
   - Event logging could grow large quickly
   - Need indexing strategy for common queries
   - Consider TimescaleDB for time-series event data
   - Implement archival/purge policies early

4. **State Consistency**
   - Multiple sources of truth (HA, local DB, cache)
   - Race conditions during arm/disarm
   - Need clear state machine with atomic transitions

5. **Security Surface**
   - Web-accessible alarm system is inherently risky
   - Consider VPN-only access option
   - Rate limiting and brute force protection critical
   - Code hashing must be secure (Argon2/bcrypt)

### Decisions Made

1. **Deployment Model**: Dockerized
   - Runs anywhere via Docker/docker-compose
   - HA URL configured via environment variable
   - Can run on same host as HA or separate hardware
   - No dependency on HA host availability for basic functions

2. **HA Integration**: Standalone App
   - No companion HA custom component
   - Communicates via HA REST API and WebSocket
   - Uses HA's native notify services for notifications
   - Independent operation when HA is unavailable

3. **Code Entry Method**: MQTT Keypad
   - Primary: Web/mobile interface
   - Physical keypad support via MQTT
   - Smart lock keypad codes synced where supported

4. **Database**: PostgreSQL
   - Standard PostgreSQL for all data
   - Event archival via retention policies
   - No TimescaleDB complexity needed initially

### Open Questions

1. **Professional Monitoring**
   - Which monitoring services to integrate?
   - SIA/Contact ID protocol support?
   - Self-hosted vs cloud monitoring API?

2. **Multi-tenant vs Single-tenant**
   - Design for single household initially
   - Consider multi-tenant in future phases?

3. **Licensing & Liability**
   - Open source license choice (MIT, Apache, GPL)?
   - Disclaimer for security-critical application
   - No warranty clause

### Performance Targets

| Operation | Target Latency |
|-----------|---------------|
| Arm/Disarm | < 500ms |
| Entry delay start | < 100ms |
| Alarm trigger | < 200ms |
| Notification send | < 2s |
| Dashboard load | < 1s |
| WebSocket update | < 100ms |

### Capacity Targets

| Metric | Initial Target |
|--------|---------------|
| Concurrent users | 10 |
| Sensors/zones | 100 |
| Events/day | 10,000 |
| Automations | 50 |
| Codes | 100 |
| Event retention | 90 days |
